An ongoing list of things I've learned.

I learned what an ES6 Weakmap is.  Then wrote a [blog post](http://enfinlay.com/es6/weakmap/til/2016/03/08/til-js-es6-weakmap.html) about it.

Learned that there are HTTP cookies, which are cookies inaccessible to Javascript on the client side and are meant to be only altered on the server side.  Cool stuff.
